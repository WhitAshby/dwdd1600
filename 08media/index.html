        <h2>About</h2>
        <p><strong>The North Shore of Oʻahu</strong> is a paradise for food lovers, offering a wide variety of local and
            international cuisines. One of the most iconic eats in the area is the garlic shrimp plate, often served
            from roadside food trucks like Giovanni’s in Kahuku. You’ll also find an abundance of fresh poke, tropical
            fruits, and refreshing shave ice, especially in the charming town of Haleʻiwa. Many local eateries pride

        </p>

        <p><strong>Beaches</strong></p>
        <p>The beaches on the North Shore are world-famous, and for good reason. In the winter months, beaches like
            Waimea Bay, Sunset Beach, and the Banzai Pipeline attract the world’s best surfers to tackle enormous waves.
            These same beaches transform into calm, swimmable havens in the summer, perfect for snorkeling, swimming, or
            simply relaxing on the sand. Turtle Bay is another scenic spot known for its clear waters and the chance to
            spot green sea turtles basking on the shore.</p>

        <p>Beyond its food and beaches, the North Shore offers plenty of activities for visitors of all ages.
            Adventurous travelers can try surfing lessons, zip-lining through the tropical forest, or hiking the Ehukai
            Pillbox trail for panoramic views of the coast. For a more laid-back experience, there’s stand-up
            paddleboarding on the Anahulu River, or exploring local art galleries and boutiques in Haleʻiwa. The area
            also hosts seasonal events like surf competitions and farmers markets that showcase the local lifestyle.</p>

        <p><strong>Food</strong></p>
